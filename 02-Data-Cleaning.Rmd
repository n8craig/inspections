# Introduction
The primary cleaning functions are incorporated into a custom function and moved to a separate R file. However, the mechanics of the transformations are displayed on this page.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(googlesheets4)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```

# Cleaning Script
First load the file and then clean the names. These operations were moved to a separate file. However, it is shown here to get a sense of what is involved.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Read in the sheet
df_inspect <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1im5VSi3bIEi13O8WQ56wEIXSyNEstbGMylXXgD9bAG0/edit#gid=1858227071",
                 sheet="Inspections",
                 col_names = TRUE,
                 col_types = "c") %>% 
  clean_names()
```

The following code is useful for isolating issues in the field names.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
df_inspect %>% 
  distinct(facility, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(facility)
```

Here the following procedures were converted to a custom function and written to an R file. The procedures are illustrated here to show the transformations.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_inspect <- df_inspect %>% 
  # Removing a curious whitespace character that appears
  # in more recent facility names
  mutate(facility = str_replace_all(facility,
         pattern = "Â ",
         replacement = " ")) %>% 
  
  separate(.,
           col = facility,
           into = c("facility","inspection_date"),
           sep = "\\) - ") %>%
  separate(.,
           col = facility,
           into = c("facility","state"),
           sep = "\\(") %>% 

  # Deal with issues in the file names, state, and inspection date
  mutate(facility = str_trim(facility, side = "both"),
         state = str_trim(state, side = "both"),
