Until this notice is removed, information in this document is subject to change as the underlying code is modified and refined. Last update: Thursday August 05, 2021 at 05:49:22 PM This project involves collating, cleaning, performing preliminary analysis of, and supplying to the public inspections related data released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE oversees a sprawling network of more than 200 immigration detention facilities. The agency is required to inspect each of these facilities at least annually according to one of several sets of detention standards. In 2018, Congressional appropriations stipulated that ICE is directed to make public all final detention facility inspection reports within 60 days of inspection (115th Congress 2017, 33). Following this, ICE began releasing pre-prepared Significant Incident Summary (SIS) forms and inspection letters. These documents do not comply with the Congressional mandate. As of July, 2021 ICE is not complying with this standing directive from Congress (see 1.3). Our aim was to assemble in one place what information ICE does release, process and provide those data using reproducible methods (Yu and Kumbier 2020; Stodden, Leisch, and Peng 2014), and offer some insights regarding what was found. 1.2 What We Found Summary numbers reported here are limited to ICE detention facility inspections that use the most current SIS form. These are all inspections between September 6, 2019 and July 1, 2021. This sample entails 200 SIS forms at 126 facilities. Within this sample of 200 inspections, 95% (n=190) received a rating of either Meets Standards or Acceptable. The ICE G-324A Significant Incident Summary is organized around the following categories of information: Assaults, Disciplinary, Solitary, Use of Force, Sexual Abuse and Assault, Medical, Cause of Death. 1.2.1 Assaults There were 3435 assaults The five facilities with the most number of assaults were: Krome Service Processing Center (n=470), Adelanto ICE Processing Center West (n=390), Prairieland Detention Center (n=330), South Texas ICE Processing Center (n=312), and Adelanto ICE Processing Center East (n=264) 1.2.2 Disciplinary Facilities logged 25826 disciplinary infractions, of these 78% (n=20144) were found guilty. Of the disciplinary infractions 1256 were appealed and 300 were found in favor of the detained person. 30 individuals experienced disciplinary sanctions over 60 days; this indicates prolonged solitary. The five facilities with the most number of disciplinary entries were: Eloy Detention Center (n=7128), La Palma (n=6954), Krome Service Processing Center (n=4888), Sherburne County Jail (n=4070), and Immigration Centers of America - Farmville (n=3808). 1.2.3 Solitary There were 37998 recorded instances of solitary confinement. Administrative solitary comprised, 45.53% (n=17302) of the cases. Disciplinary solitary made up 25.65% (n=9745) of the cases. Solitary confinement for mental health reasons made up 2.64% (n=1003) of the cases. 1.2.4 Use of Force There were 22634 use of force incidents. Strip searches constituted 91.14% (n=20629) of the use of force incidents. There were 365 use of force incidents involving chemical agents, making up 1.61 of the use of force incidents. There is reason to believe that use of force incidents are significantly under reported (Section 6.2). 1.2.5 Sexual Abuse and Assault 748 sexual abuse allegations, &gt;500 detained person on detained person, 189 staff or contractor on detained person 102 allegations substantiated, &gt;90 detained person on detained person, 6 staff or contractor on detained persons 1.2.6 Medical Observation &gt;25,000 individuals under medical observation, &gt;4500 for mental health 9666 instances of infectious diseases confirmed &gt;56,000 outside medical referrals, &gt;9300 for emergency care, &gt;580 for mental health reasons &gt;240 suicide attempts, &gt;5100 individuals placed on suicide watch. &gt;1300 hunger strikes 1.3 Note Regarding Inspections In 2018, ICE established a Facilities Inspection web page and began releasing documents back to May of that year.1 The website states that ICE is posting all facility inspection reports submitted by the third-party contractor. The reports are posted below in chronological order within 60 days of inspection. For each inspection report ICE supplies two documents: a G-324A form known as a Significant Incident Summary (SIS) and, a cover letter by the inspections contractor The Nakamoto Group.2 There are two major versions of the G324A form, one revised in 2007/2008 (Figure 1.1) and another revised in 2019 (Figure 1.2). Both versions of the G-324A form state that the following information must be completed prior to the scheduled review dates (underline in original) and that [t]his form should be filled out by the facility prior to the start of any inspection. Figure 1.1: Pre-2019 Form G 324-A SIS showing instructions. Figure 1.2: Post-2019 Form G 324-A SIS showing instructions. Congress directed ICE to release all final detention facility reports. ICE claims to post all facility inspection reports, but instead ICE is posting SIS forms that must be filled out before inspectors even arrive at the facility. Full facility inspection reports regularly run in excess of 150 pages. There are examples of complete inspections obtained by National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC) through FOIA (NIJC 2015). Outside of those earlier FOIA requests, which required lengthy litigation by the NIJC to force compliance, ICE has released no full inspection reports and is not complying with an unambiguous Congressional mandate to do so. Though not in compliance, the SIS and cover letter forms do provide some information to the public. Unfortunately, data are siloed in individual pdf documents. To make matters worse, as of February 2021, under the Biden administration, ICE changed its protocol and began releasing un OCRd bit-mapped versions of the SIS forms. Previously, these forms were released as full text pdfs. The decision by ICE to do this to SIS forms makes it that much harder to use the data that are released.3 This project seeks to retrieve data from these documents, clean and organize that information into a usable form, and supply it along with some preliminary analysis to the public. 1.4 How the work was done During the Summer of 2021, data from the SIS and inspection cover letters was compiled into a series of spreadsheets; this work is still in progress. Nathan Craig developed the idea for a project to collate and organize information in SIS and inspection cover letters to examine them for trends, patterns, and anomalies. The work was performed by three students funded under a National Science Foundation grant awarded to Dr. Neil Harvey (NMSU) and Dr. Jeremy Slack (NMSU). The students who performed the work were Juan Becerra (Stanford), Avigail Turima Romo (Columbia), and Daniela Navarro Verdugo (CSSLO). The three students and Dr. Craig developed a workflow for compiling individual SIS and inspection cover letters into a series of spreadsheets. These web pages, still in development, document those procedures, and provide some initial summary. Much of the analysis is done in R (R Core Team 2021) relying on the tidyverse (Wickham 2021) with ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2021). References "],["inspection-standards-and-ratings.html", "Section 2 Inspection Standards and Ratings 2.1 Standards Applied 2.2 Inspections by Facility and Operator 2.3 Recommended Rating", " Section 2 Inspection Standards and Ratings All adult facility inspections listed on the ICE website were inspected by The Nakamoto Group. There are two major sets of standards and several versions of each. These are the Performance Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) for dedicated facilities and the National Detention Standards for non-dedicated facilities. PBNDS has two versions: PBNDS 2008 and PBNDS 2011 with revisions in 2016. NDS also has two versions: NDS 2000 and NDS 2019. Though ICE detention is not punitive, both sets of standards are based on corrections models (Schriro 2009, 23). Except for Service Processing Centers managed by ICE, all facilities are managed by either private prison companies, sheriffs offices, or a local corrections board. ICE relies primarily on correctional incarceration standards designed for pre-trial felons and on correctional principles of care, custody, and control. These standards impose more restrictions and carry more costs than are necessary to effectively manage the majority of the detained population (Schriro 2009, 23). 2.1 Standards Applied Between September 6, 2019 and July 1, 2021, 200 facilities were inspected. Of these, 56% (n=112) were inspected under some version of PBNDS and 43.5% (n=87) were inspected under some version of NDS (Table 2.1). Table 2.1: Summary of inspections by type of standard.

Notably, the fifth non-passing facility is Krome, a dedicated ICE Service Processing Center. It bears mention that Krome was the first service processing center established in 1980 under the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and since its founding is a facility riddled with problems (Simon 1998.; Lindskoog 2018; Loyd and Mountz 2018; Lipman 2013; Helton 1986a, 1986b).

Over the course of 21.83 months represented by the inspections in this sample, there were on average 157 assaults per month.The majority of those assaults occurred between detained persons and did not result in serious injury (86%, n=2926). The SIS form does distinguish if an assault on a person detained by ICE was by another person detained by ICE or by a person detained under a corrections context. This is an important detail because many facilities are mixed use wherein individuals detained for civil immigration purposes are in corrections facilities.

This omission is deeply concerning because prior news stories and review of the inspection forms themselves show that staff assaults on detained persons do occur. However, these are generally described as use of force incidents and are not tallied as assaults. Use of force incidents are described in Section 1.2.4. "],["disciplinary-1.html", "Section 4 Disciplinary", " Section 4 Disciplinary As a matter of law, ICE detention is not punitive it is purely administrative civil holding to ensure that individuals are present for their immigration proceedings (ICE 2016, i; Schriro 2009, 23). Despite that fact, punitive disciplinary actions are logged on ICEs G-324A SIS form. The form also lists the number of disciplinary fractions found guilty, appeals, and appeals in favor of detained persons. During the 21.83 months covering the period between September 6, 2019 and July 1, 2021, there were 25826 disciplinary infractions issued by facility operators (Table 4.1). There were an average of 131.25 (SD = 251.18) disciplinary infractions per facility by inspection (Figure 4.1 and Table 4.2). Four facilities have significantly greater than average number of disciplinary infractions per inspection. Of the facilities with significantly greater than average number of disciplinary infractions issued per inspection two are managed by CoreCivic, one is managed by Immigration Centers of America, and one is a service processing center managed by ICE.

These are anodyne euphemisms for solitary confinement. The G-324A SIS form records information on four kinds of solitary confinement: administrative disciplinary medical mental health During the 21.83 months covering the period between September 6, 2019 and July 1, 2021, there were 37998 instances of solitary reported (Tables 5.1, 5.2, and Figure 5.1). There was an average of 184.79 (SD=357.92) instances of segregation per facility by inspection. Six facilities have significantly higher than average number of solitary instances reported per inspection. Of these facilities two are managed by ICE, one is managed by the Henderson Police Department, two are operated by CoreCivic, and one is managed by LaSalle Corrections. Roughly half of the total instances of solitary were administrative segregation (45.53%, n = 17302) while disciplinary (25.65%, n = 9745) and medical (26.18%, n =9948) segregation made up nearly the other half. Mental health segregation (2.64%, n = 1003) comprised a relatively small proportion of the total number of solitary instances and still surpassed 1000 instances.

It is unclear why form G-324A has an entry for reporting uses of disciplinary solitary exceeding the 60 day maximum defined by PBNDS. Based on the inspections reviewed there were 400 instances of segregation &gt; 60 days reported (Figures 5.2, 5.3, and Table 5.3). Of these cases, 87% (n=348) involved administrative solitary and 13% (n=52) involved disciplinary solitary. Within this sample of inspections, there were on average 1.86 (SD=5.23) instances of segregation greater than 60 days per inspection. There are five facilities that have significantly higher than average number of incidents of solitary greater than 60 days. Of these, one is operated by MTC, three by the GEO Group, and one by CoreCivic. MTCs Imperial Regional Detention Facility stands out with more than double the next two highest ranking facilities regarding solitary &gt; 60 days.

Based on this average five facilities have significantly greater than average non-strip search use of force incidents per inspection. Of these, two facilities are managed by CoreCivic, one by the GeoGroup, one by Immigration Centers of America, and one by the Glades County Sheriff.

However, in at least some circumstances evidence indicates that use of force incidents are inaccurately documented and under reported. For example, in some instances strip searches are tallied in total use of force summaries and in other cases they are not. The Bristol County Jail is one noteworthy instance where use of force incidents received independent evaluation. On May 2, 2020 Massachusetts news outlets reported on a major incident that occurred at the Bristol County House of Correction the previous day when detained persons expressed concern about the potential for COVID-19 infection from the facilitys medical wing (Dooling 2020). The Bristol County Sheriff claimed that people refused to go to the medical unit for testing, and those detained reported being attacked with pepper spray and dogs. Nakamoto Group Inspectors visited the facility between November 16-18, 2020 and reviewed it under PBNDS 2008 (ICE and The Nakamoto Group 2020). The inspectors received a G-324 SIS which reported use of force incidents (Figure 6.2). For May, the sheet lists 1 Immediate Use of Force Incident, 1 Use of Force with Chemical Agents, 1 Incident where Non-Lethal Weapons were Used, and 3 Strip Searches. The sheet lists no Use of Force with Serious Injury. Nakamoto Group inspectors found that the facility met all 39 standards and had only three deficient components: Key and Lock Control, Special Management Unit, and Suicide Prevention and Intervention. The Nakamoto inspection letter made no mention of use of force incidents. Figure 6.2: Cropped from Bristol County Jail SIS Form G-324 (ICE and The Nakamoto Group 2020, 4). The Massachusetts Attorney Generals Office (MA AG) independently investigated the major incident that occurred on May 1, 2020 (MA AG 2020). The MA AGs factual findings (MA AG 2020, 2441) identifies: 2 instances involving immediate use of force; 1 immediate use of force incident with a chemical agent; 1 calculated use of force incident that involved 16 officers armed with pepper spray, flash bang grenades, riot shields, shotguns with bean bag rounds, pepper ball launchers, battering rams, multiple K9 teams; and another 12 person restraint team. The Calculated Use of Force Incident unfolded over the course of more than an hour and involved the deployment of flash bang grenades; firing more than 30 rounds of pepper balls, several of which directly hit individuals; numerous instances involving K-9 use of force, and multiple hands on use of force instances. Additionally, the MA AG found multiple cases where individuals suffered serious injuries as the result of the use of force: 1 individual experienced cardiac arrest 1 individual with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suffered respiratory distress 1 individual experienced respiratory distress resulting in critically low oxygen levels The MA AG concluded that a series of institutional failures and poor decisions culminated in a planned and deliberateuse of force against the ICE B detainees that was disproportionate to the security needs at that time and unnecessarily caused, or risked causing, harm to all involved(MA AG 2020, ii). The MA AG found that facility staff used a flash bang grenade, pepper-ball launchers, pepper spray canisters, anti-riot shields, and caninesagainst detainees who had exhibited calm and nonviolent behavior for at least an hour before this operation(MA AG 2020, ii). MA AG found that staff deployed these weapons both indiscriminately upon entry and also specifically against detainees who were not combative, assaultive, or otherwise actively resisting staff (MA AOG 2020, ii). The details of the May 1, 2020 Use of Force incident do not come to light in either SIS form or the Nakamoto Group inspection cover letter. The SIS form inaccurately characterizes the multiple Use of Force incidents entailed in the event, fails to report what is clearly a Calculated Use of Force, and does not report multiple Use of Force Incidents with Serious Injury that resulted from from the extensive use of pepper spray. Inspectors made no mention of the use of muzzled and unmuzzled canine units that were deployed for control and intimidation. The Nakamoto cover letter states that, the detainees felt safe in the facility and registered no substantive complaints about any aspect of their detention except for their exposure to the COVID-19 risk in the facility. Inspectors wrote that [t]here were no areas of concern or significant observations noted during the inspection but noted that the inspection was conducted remotely, and inspectors were unable to personally observe practices and procedures with-in the facility and that the inspection team relied upon photographs and/or videos to validate the observation of many standards. While the aforementioned Bristol County Jail may be a particularly egregious instance of staff assaulting detained persons, it is not an isolated case. For example, video evidence from the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia NM shows CoreCivics private facility staff pepper spraying persons detained by ICE on hunger strike (Swetlitz 2020). Review of inspections has also revealed additional inappropriate use of force incidents. The omission of a field to record instances of staff assaulting detained persons occludes and obscures real instances of violence. As the inspections process is a detention reform designed to make a more humane system of civil incarceration, the omission of categories for logging staff physical mistreatment of detained persons raises serious questions about the inspections processes ability to record significant and documented civil and human rights violations.

"],["reading-in-sis-forms.html", "A Reading in SIS Forms A.1 Summary Tables A.2 Facet Plots", " A Reading in SIS Forms The code for this report is specific to data logged in the G-324A-19 form and the incident summaries portion of that form. The incident summary portion of this form is probably the most complex data structure in the project and also contains the largest volume of quantitative information. Therefore, it seemed like a good place to start with an initial proof of concept. At the outset, there were issues reading in the Google Sheet. Several of the numeric columns read into R as lists which was undesirable. In the Google Sheet, Craig set the columns to plain text rather than auto and the data are read into R as character columns. This seemed to resolve the issue for a time, and it was possible to use the type_convert() function from the readr library (Wickham and Hester 2020) to convert these columns to numbers. The col_types argument of the read_sheet function of the googlesheets4 library (Bryan 2021) was used to explicitly set the column types to character. After applying the clean_facility_names custom function, additional transformations like converting facility to a factor are applied. There were some issues using lubridate (Spinu, Grolemund, and Wickham 2021) to wrangle the month and year fields to a proper date. Craig was not able to discern the cause of the issue. However, changing the month format on the incident sheet from abbreviated to fully written out months solved the issue. Those changes were made in the master Google Sheet and the data were called using the googlesheets4 library. At present 382 SIS and inspection cover letter combinations out of approximately 300 inspections are complete. The completed inspections range in time from 2019-09-06 to 2021-07-01. Students are now working on older SIS forms which are structured differently. The preliminary EDA in this document is restricted to the more current SIS forms which were first used in May 2019. A.1 Summary Tables Summary tables help to provide an overview of how many instances occur within particular category of data or how frequent a particular issue is recorded at a given facility. Summary tables are generated using a combination of group_by with summarize with the results piped to kable and kableExtra. This produces results similar to a pivot table from Excel. A.2 Facet Plots Facet plots partition each portion of a plot into a matrix of panels. These plots are produced for several categories of data where each panel represents a facility for a given variable reported in the SIS form. Within each category, columns are pivoted longer and plotted by date. Graphing is done using the ggplot2 library (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2021) with the facet_wrap function to provide a means to compare multiple facilities simultaneously. Such a plot can help identify trends and guide more specific questions. References "],["data-cleaning.html", "B Data Cleaning B.1 Cleaning Script", " B Data Cleaning Anyone familiar working with ICE data knows that the agency is notorious for releasing dirty data filled with pesky errors. For example, consider the Krome Service Processing Center, the very first immigration processing center established in the 1980s after the closure of Ellis Island in 1954. Of all the facilities the agency should name consistently, Krome the very first detention center of the contemporary system, one would expect ICE to get right. However, the facility inspections page lists the following names for the Krome Service Processing Center: Krome Special Processing Center (SPC) (FL) - Feb. 10, 2021 Krome Service Procesing Center (FL) - Feb. 13, 2020 Krome SPC (FL) - Feb. 14, 2019 Every instance is different. In one case Special is replaced for Service. In another case the word processing is misspelled Procesing, while in a third, the title is abbreviated. This is one example of many. In other cases facilities are sometimes named Detention Center rather than Detention Facility, etc. Assembling the data into a useful table that can be sorted, filtered, and summarized requires standardizing the names. From early on, Craig decided to assemble the data as reported, errors and all, and perform standardization programmatically. Doing this facilitates reproducibility. The projects primary cleaning functions are incorporated into a custom function clean_facility_names() and moved to a separate R file. This allows more than 100 lines of code to be collapsed into a single function call. However, for display purposes, the lines of code that make up the transformations are detailed on this page. B.1 Cleaning Script During the time that the students were assembling data, we worked out of a Google Sheet as this permitted each of us to have simultaneous access to the data. For preliminary analysis, a data frame is constructed by reading from the sheet. # Read in the sheet df_inspect &lt;- read_sheet(&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1im5VSi3bIEi13O8WQ56wEIXSyNEstbGMylXXgD9bAG0/edit#gid=1858227071&quot;, sheet=&quot;Inspections&quot;, col_names = TRUE, col_types = &quot;c&quot;) %&gt;% clean_names() Sometimes facility names are repeated. Use of the dplyr function distinct is useful for isolating issues with field names (Wickham, François, et al. 2021).
