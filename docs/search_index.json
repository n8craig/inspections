[["disciplinary-1.html", "Section 4 Disciplinary 4.1 Facet Plot of Disciplinary by Facility", " Section 4 Disciplinary As a matter of law, ICE detention is not punitive it is purely administrative civil holding to ensure that individuals are present for their immigration proceedings (REFF). Despite that fact, there is a tremendous amount of punitive disciplinary actions that occur in ICE detention facilities. Some of this information on discipline in ICE detention is logged in facility inspections. During the 20.68 covering the period between September 6, 2019 and May 27, 2021, there were 46258 disciplinary infractions issued by facility operators (Table 4.1). There were an average of 245.04 (SD = 437.33) disciplinary infractions per facility by inspection (Table 4.2). Four facilities have significantly greater than average number of disciplinary infractions per inspection (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). Of the facilities with greater than average number of disciplinary infractions issued per inspection two are managed by CoreCivic, one is managed by Immigration Centers of America, and one is managed by ICE.
