In 2018, Congressional appropriations stipulated that ICE is directed to make public all final detention facility inspection reports within 60 days of inspection (Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, 2018 2017, 33). As of July, 2021 ICE is not complying with this standing directive from Congress. In 2018, ICE established a Facilities Inspection web page and began releasing documents back to May of that year.1 The website states that ICE is posting all facility inspection reports submitted by the third-party contractor. The reports are posted below in chronological order within 60 days of inspection. For each inspection report ICE supplies two documents: a G-324A form known as a Significant Incident Summary (SIS) and, a cover letter by the inspections contractor The Nakamoto Group.2 There are two major versions of the G324A form, one revised in 2007/2008 and another revised in 2019. Both versions of the G-324A form state that the following information must be completed prior to the scheduled review dates (underline in original) and that [t]his form should be filled out by the facility prior to the start of any inspection. Pre-2019 Form G324-A SIS showing instructions Post-2019 Form G324-A SIS showing instructions Congress directed ICE to release all final detention facility reports. ICE claims to post all facility inspection reports, but instead ICE is posting SIS forms that must be filled out before inspectors even arrive at the facility. Full facility inspection reports regularly run in excess of 150 pages. There are examples of complete inspections obtained by National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC) through FOIA (NIJC 2015). Outside of those earlier FOIA requests, which required lengthy litigation by the NIJC to force compliance, ICE has released no full inspection reports and is not complying with an unambiguous Congressional mandate to do so. Though not in compliance, the SIS and cover letter forms do provide some information to the public. Unfortunately, data are siloed in individual pdf documents and presented in tables that are not commensurate with comparative analysis. To make matters worse, as of February 2021, ICE under the Biden administration began releasing un OCRd bit-mapped versions of the SIS forms. Previously, these forms were released as full text pdfs. The decision by ICE to do this to SIS forms makes it that much harder to use the data that are released.3 This project seeks to retrieve data from these documents, clean and organize that information into a usable form, and supply it along with some preliminary analysis to the public. How the work was done During the Summer of 2021, data from the SIS and inspection cover letters was compiled into a series of spreadsheets, note this work is still in progress. Nathan Craig developed the idea for a project to collate and organize information in SIS and inspection cover letters to examine them for trends, patterns, and anomalies. The work was performed by three students funded under a National Science Foundation grant awarded to Dr. Neil Harvey (NMSU) and Dr. Jeremy Slack (NMSU). The students who performed the work were Juan Becerra (Stanford), Avigail Turima Romo (Columbia), and Daniela Navarro Verdugo (CSSLO). The three students worked with Dr. Craig to develop a workflow for compiling individual SIS and inspection cover letters into a series of spreadsheets. These web pages, still in development, document those procedures. Much of the analysis is done in R (R Core Team 2021), tidyverse (Wickham 2021), and ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2021). References "],["data-cleaning.html", "Section 1 Data Cleaning 1.1 Cleaning Script", " Section 1 Data Cleaning Anyone familiar working with ICE data knows that the agency is notorious for releasing dirty data filled with pesky errors. For example, consider the Krome Service Processing Center, the very first immigration processing center established in the 1980s after the closure of Ellis Island in 1954. Of all the facilities the agency should name consistently, Krome the very first detention center of the contemporary system, one would expect ICE to get right. However, the facility inspections page lists the following names for the Krome Service Processing Center: Krome Special Processing Center (SPC) (FL) - Feb. 10, 2021 Krome Service Procesing Center (FL) - Feb. 13, 2020 Krome SPC (FL) - Feb. 14, 2019 Every instance is different. In one case Special is replaced for Service. In another case the word processing is misspelled Procesing, while in a third, the title is abbreviated. This is one example of many. In other cases facilities are sometimes named Detention Center rather than Detention Facility, etc. Assembling the data into a useful table that can be sorted, filtered, and summarized requires standardizing the names. From early on, Craig decided to assemble the data as reported, errors and all, and perform standardization programmatically. Doing this facilitates reproducibility. The projects primary cleaning functions are incorporated into a custom function clean_facility_names() and moved to a separate R file. This allows more than 100 lines of code to be collapsed into a single function call. However, for display purposes, the lines of code that make up the transformations are detailed on this page. 1.1 Cleaning Script During the time that the students were assembling data, we worked out of a Google Sheet as this permitted each of us to have simultaneous access to the data. For preliminary analysis, a data frame is constructed by reading from the sheet. # Read in the sheet df_inspect &lt;- read_sheet(&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1im5VSi3bIEi13O8WQ56wEIXSyNEstbGMylXXgD9bAG0/edit#gid=1858227071&quot;, sheet=&quot;Inspections&quot;, col_names = TRUE, col_types = &quot;c&quot;) %&gt;% clean_names() Sometimes facility names are repeated.

Goals of the document are to: illustrate the kinds of analysis possible with the tabulation of ICE inspection data provide preliminary exploratory plot of select variables from the Significant Incident Summary Sheets. generate some preliminary summary information The data are presently incomplete and represent results compiled as of 2021-07-07. 2.1 Method for Reading G-324A-19-inc form The code for this report is specific to data logged in the G-324A-19 form and the incident summaries portion of that form. The incident summary portion of this form is probably the most complex data structure in the project and also contains the largest volume of quantitative information. Therefore, it seemed like a good place to start with an initial proof of concept. At the outset, there were issues reading in the Google Sheet. Several of the numeric columns read into R as lists which was undesirable. In the Google Sheet, Craig set the columns to plain text rather than auto and the data are read into R as character columns. This seemed to resolve the issue for a time, and it was possible to use the type_convert() function from the readr library (Wickham and Hester 2020) to convert these columns to numbers. The col_types argument of the read_sheet function of the googlesheets4 library (Bryan 2021) was used to explicitly set the column types to character. After applying the clean_facility_names custom function, additional transformations like converting facility to a factor are applied. There were some issues using lubridate (Spinu, Grolemund, and Wickham 2021) to wrangle the month and year fields to a proper date. Craig was not able to discern the cause of the issue. However, changing the month format on the incident sheet from abbreviated to fully written out months solved the issue. Those changes were made in the master Google Sheet and the data were called using the googlesheets4 library. # Read in Sheet G-324A-19 df_324 &lt;- read_sheet(&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1im5VSi3bIEi13O8WQ56wEIXSyNEstbGMylXXgD9bAG0/edit#gid=1858227071&quot;, sheet=&quot;G-324A-19&quot;, col_names = TRUE, col_types = &quot;c&quot;) %&gt;% clean_names() %&gt;% # Run custom cleaning function clean_facility_names() %&gt;% # df specific changes mutate(facility = as.factor(facility), state = as.factor(state), date = mdy(inspection_date), current_inspection_date_from = mdy(current_inspection_date_from), current_inspection_date_to = mdy(current_inspection_date_to) ) %&gt;% relocate(date, .before = inspection_date) %&gt;% mutate_at(c(20:49), as.numeric) # Read Google Sheet incident worksheet, convert to data frame, and wrangle df_324_inc &lt;- read_sheet(&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1im5VSi3bIEi13O8WQ56wEIXSyNEstbGMylXXgD9bAG0/edit#gid=1858227071&quot;, sheet=&quot;G-324A-19-inc&quot;, col_types = &quot;c&quot;) %&gt;% clean_names() %&gt;% # Run custom cleaning function clean_facility_names() %&gt;% # df_specific changes unite(date, year:month) %&gt;% mutate(facility = as.factor(facility), state = as.factor(state), date = ym(date) ) %&gt;% mutate_at(c(6:76), as.numeric) At present 199 SIS and inspection cover letter combinations out of approximately 300 inspections are complete. The completed inspections range in time from 2019-08-22 to 2021-05-27. Students are now working on older SIS forms which are structured differently. The preliminary EDA in this document is restricted to the more current SIS forms which were first used in May 2019. 2.2 SIS Form structure The ICE G-324A Significant Incident Summary contains information on the following categories of information: Assaults Disciplinary Solitary Use of Force Sexual Abuse and Assault Medical Cause of Death As a preliminary step of analysis, each of these categories is explored with a summary table and facet plot in order to look at larger trends. 2.3 Summary Tables Summary tables help to provide an overview of how many instances occur within particular category of data or how frequent a particular issue is recorded at a given facility. Summary tables are generated using a combination of group_by with summarize with the results piped to kable and kableExtra. This produces results similar to a pivot table from Excel. Table 2.1 shows the number of inspections per facility that are processed so far. The values range from 1-3 inspections. Dorchester County Detention Center, Golden State Annex, and River Correctional Center all have three inspections.

These plots are produced for several categories of data where each panel represents a facility for a given variable reported in the SIS form. Within each category, columns are pivoted longer and plotted by date. Graphing is done using the ggplot2 library (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2021) with the facet_wrap function to provide a means to compare multiple facilities simultaneously. Such a plot can help identify trends and guide more specific questions. References "],["assaults.html", "Section 3 Assaults 3.1 Summary Tables 3.2 Facet Plot of Assaults by Facility", " Section 3 Assaults The ICE G-324A Significant Incident Summary sheet contains information on a number of different kinds of assaults. Specifically, there are four categories of assaults listed: Detained Person on Staff with Serious Injury Detained Person on Staff without Serious Injury Detained Person on Detained Person with Serious Injury Detained Person on Detained Person without Serious Injury Conspicuously absent from this list of assault types are assaults on detained persons by staff. This is deeply concerning because already initial review of inspection forms and prior news stories indicates that staff assaults on detained persons do occur. For example, at the Bristol County County Jail and House of Corrections independent investigation by the Massachusetts Office of Attorney General (MAOG) found that facility staff found a planned and deliberate-use of force against the ICE detainees that was disproportionate to the security needs at that time and unnecessarily caused, or risked causing, harm to all involved (MA AG 2020, ii). The MOAG found that facility staff used a flash bang grenade, pepper-ball launchers, pepper spray canisters, anti-riot shields, and caninesagainst detainees who had exhibited calm and nonviolent behavior for at least an hour before this operation (MA AG 2020, ii). Investigations found that staff deployed these weapons both indiscriminately upon entry and also specifically against detainees who were not combative, assaultive, or otherwise actively resisting staff (MA AG 2020, ii). While the aforementioned Bristol County Jail may be a particularly egregious instance of staff assaulting detained persons, it is not an isolated case. For example, video evidence from the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia NM shows CoreCivics private facility staff pepper spraying persons detained by ICE on hunger strike (Swetlitz 2020). Review of inspections has also revealed additional inappropriate use of force incidents. The omission of a field to record instances of staff assaulting detained persons occludes and obscures real instances of violence. As the inspections process is a detention reform designed to make a more humane system of civil incarceration, the omission of categories for logging staff physical mistreatment of detained persons raises serious questions about the inspections processes ability to record significant and documented civil and human rights violations. 3.1 Summary Tables Table 3.1: Total Assaults by Type Assault Type Total Assault Type detainee_physical_assault_on_staff_with_serious_injury 13 detainee_physical_assault_on_staff_with_no_serious_injury 333 detainee_on_detainee_physical_assault_fight_with_serious_injury 126 detainee_on_detainee_physical_assault_fight_with_no_serious_injury 2926 total_assaults 3390 Table 3.1: Total Assaults by Facility Facility Total Assaults by Facility Krome Service Processing Center 470 Adelanto ICE Processing Center - West 390 Prairieland Detention Center 330 South Texas ICE Processing Center 312 Adelanto ICE Processing Center - East 264 Otero County Processing Center 240 Aurora ICE Processing Center 222 Aurora ICE Processing Center II - Annex 222 Stewart Detention Center 218 Eloy Detention Center 216 Otay Mesa Detention Center 200 El Paso Service Processing Center 192 Winn Correctional Center 172 Essex County Correctional Facility 146 Imperial Regional Detention Facility 136 LaSalle ICE Processing Center 128 Hudson County Corrections and Rehabilitation Center 118 Immigration Centers of America - Farmville 108 River Correctional Center 106 Caroline Detention Facility 104 Jena LaSalle Detention Facility 98 Yuba County Jail 96 Adams County Correctional Center 94 La Palma Correctional Center 92 Bergen County Jail 86 Northwest ICE Processing Center 78 Catahoula Correctional Center 72 Mesa Verde ICE Processing Facility 72 Port Isabel Service Processing Center 70 Folkston ICE Processing Center 68 Bluebonnet Detention Center 64 Montgomery Processing Center 60 Pulaski County Detention Center 60 Sherburne County Jail 60 Houston Contract Detention Facility 58 Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center 58 Baker County Detention Center 54 Calhoun County Correctional Center 54 Limestone County Detention Center 50 Polk County Adult Detention Center 50 Irwin County Detention Center 48 McHenry County Adult Correctional Facility 48 Strafford County Department of Corrections 46 Allen Parish Public Safety Complex 45 Krome North Service Processing Center 40 Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility 34 Nye County Detention Center 34 Pike County Correctional Facility 32 Webb County Detention Center 32 CCA Florence Correctional Center 30 Joe Corley Processing Center 30 Wakulla County Detention Facility 30 David L.

"],["observations-while-assembling-data.html", "Section 10 Observations While Assembling Data 10.1 28 May 2021 10.2 27 May 2021", " Section 10 Observations While Assembling Data Observations made on the data as they accumulate are logged below. 10.1 28 May 2021 Adelanto ICE Processing Center - East and West have identical data for 2020, but the numbers are different for 2019 with East being much lower than west. Craig checked the inspections and the numbers are different for East and West in 2019 while they are in fact the same for 2020. Note that 2020 is a remote inspection. However, it is significant that the two are comparable in one instance and not comparable in another case. Almance County Jail and Chase County Detention Center both seem to register blank for solitary. Craig suspects this is because there were not cases of solitary reported. 10.2 27 May 2021 One of the important early observations has to do with the naming of facilities. ICE is often inconsistent with facility naming and the names do often change over time. Both the changing of names and inconsistent naming conventions can cause confusion as well as error when tabulating results. The graphs for Adelanto ICE Processing Center - East and Adelanto ICE Processing Center - West are identical. This is consistent with information Craig recalls seeing in one of the inspections, that the numbers for the facilities are merged or combined. For facet graphing consider filtering. For analysis purposes may need to treat the two facilities as merged Adelanto ICE Processing Center West should be combined with Adelanto ICE Processing Center - West. It appears that ICE is not consistently naming the facilities, in one case the name lacks a dash character which causes them to be graphed separately. The dash was added to Adelanto West. It would be good to check if there really two facilities in Almance County. There are entries listed for Almance County Detention Center and Almance County Jail. Need to verify that these are in fact distinct facilities. Aurora ICE Processing Center II - Annex and Aurora II Annex should probably be combined. Need to check the inspections to verify. Aurora II Annex (CO) - Jan. 29, 2021\" was changed toAurora ICE Processing Center II - Annex (CO) - Jan. 29, 2021\" "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
