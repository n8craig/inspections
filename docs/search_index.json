ICE oversees a sprawling network of more than 200 immigration detention facilities. The agency is required to inspect each of these facilities at least annually according to one of several sets of detention standards. In 2018, Congressional appropriations stipulated that ICE is directed to make public all final detention facility inspection reports within 60 days of inspection (Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, 2018 2017, 33). As of July, 2021 ICE is not complying with this standing directive from Congress (see 1.2). Our aim was to assemble this information together in one place, process and provide the data using reproducible methods (Yu and Kumbier 2020; Stodden, Leisch, and Peng 2014), and offer some insights regarding what we found. 1.1 What We Found This portion of the project looks at all ICE detention facility inspections that use the most current Significant Incident Summary (SIS) form. These are all inspections between September 6, 2019 and May 27, 2021. This sample entails 198 SIS forms at 158 facilities. Within this sample of 198 inspections, 94.95% (n=188) received a rating of either Meets Standards or Acceptable. The ICE G-324A Significant Incident Summary is organized around the following categories of information: Assaults, Disciplinary, Solitary, Use of Force, Sexual Abuse and Assault, Medical, Cause of Death. 1.1.1 Assaults There were 3398 assaults The five facilities with the most number of assaults were: Krome Service Processing Center (n=470), Adelanto ICE Processing Center West (n=390), Prairieland Detention Center (n=330), South Texas ICE Processing Center (n=312), and Adelanto ICE Processing Center East (n=264) 1.1.2 Disciplinary Facilities logged 46258 disciplinary infractions, of these 42.39% (n=19610) were found guilty. Of the disciplinary infractions 1234 were appealed and 295 were found in favor of the detained person. 30 individuals experienced disciplinary sanctions over 60 days; this indicates prolonged solitary. The five facilities with the most number of disciplinary entries were: Eloy Detention Center (n=7128), La Palma (n=6954), Krome Service Processing Center (n=4888), Sherburne County Jail (n=4070), and Immigration Centers of America - Farmville (n=3808). 1.1.3 Solitary There were 37659 recorded instances of solitary confinement. Administrative solitary comprised, 45.77% (n=17236) of the cases. Disciplinary solitary made up 25.36% (n=9551) of the cases. Solitary confinement for mental health reasons made up 2.66% (n=1003) of the cases. 1.1.4 Use of Force There were 22617 use of force incidents. Strip searches constituted 91.21% (n=20629) of the use of force incidents. There were 362 use of force incidents involving chemical agents, making up 1.6 of the use of force incidents. There is reason to believe that use of force incidents are significantly under reported (Section 6.2). 1.1.5 Sexual Abuse and Assault 748 sexual abuse allegations, &gt;500 detained person on detained person, 189 staff or contractor on detained person 102 allegations substantiated, &gt;90 detained person on detained person, 6 staff or contractor on detained persons 1.1.6 Medical Observation &gt;25,000 individuals under medical observation, &gt;4500 for mental health 9666 instances of infectious diseases confirmed &gt;56,000 outside medical referrals, &gt;9300 for emergency care, &gt;580 for mental health reasons &gt;240 suicide attempts, &gt;5100 individuals placed on suicide watch. &gt;1300 hunger strikes 1.2 Note Regarding Inspections In 2018, ICE established a Facilities Inspection web page and began releasing documents back to May of that year.1 The website states that ICE is posting all facility inspection reports submitted by the third-party contractor. The reports are posted below in chronological order within 60 days of inspection. For each inspection report ICE supplies two documents: a G-324A form known as a Significant Incident Summary (SIS) and, a cover letter by the inspections contractor The Nakamoto Group.2 There are two major versions of the G324A form, one revised in 2007/2008 and another revised in 2019. Both versions of the G-324A form state that the following information must be completed prior to the scheduled review dates (underline in original) and that [t]his form should be filled out by the facility prior to the start of any inspection. Pre-2019 Form G324-A SIS showing instructions Post-2019 Form G324-A SIS showing instructions Congress directed ICE to release all final detention facility reports. ICE claims to post all facility inspection reports, but instead ICE is posting SIS forms that must be filled out before inspectors even arrive at the facility. Full facility inspection reports regularly run in excess of 150 pages. There are examples of complete inspections obtained by National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC) through FOIA (NIJC 2015). Outside of those earlier FOIA requests, which required lengthy litigation by the NIJC to force compliance, ICE has released no full inspection reports and is not complying with an unambiguous Congressional mandate to do so. Though not in compliance, the SIS and cover letter forms do provide some information to the public. Unfortunately, data are siloed in individual pdf documents and presented in tables that are not commensurate with comparative analysis. To make matters worse, as of February 2021, ICE under the Biden administration began releasing un OCRd bit-mapped versions of the SIS forms. Previously, these forms were released as full text pdfs. The decision by ICE to do this to SIS forms makes it that much harder to use the data that are released.3 This project seeks to retrieve data from these documents, clean and organize that information into a usable form, and supply it along with some preliminary analysis to the public. 1.3 How the work was done During the Summer of 2021, data from the SIS and inspection cover letters was compiled into a series of spreadsheets, note this work is still in progress. Nathan Craig developed the idea for a project to collate and organize information in SIS and inspection cover letters to examine them for trends, patterns, and anomalies. The work was performed by three students funded under a National Science Foundation grant awarded to Dr. Neil Harvey (NMSU) and Dr. Jeremy Slack (NMSU). The students who performed the work were Juan Becerra (Stanford), Avigail Turima Romo (Columbia), and Daniela Navarro Verdugo (CSSLO). The three students worked with Dr. Craig to develop a workflow for compiling individual SIS and inspection cover letters into a series of spreadsheets. These web pages, still in development, document those procedures. Much of the analysis is done in R (R Core Team 2021), tidyverse (Wickham 2021), and ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2021). 1.4 Inspections by Facility Table 1.1 shows the number of inspections per facility that are processed so far. The values range from 1-3 inspections. Dorchester County Detention Center, Golden State Annex, and River Correctional Center all have three inspections.

There are two major sets of standards and several versions of each. The two major sets of standards are the Performance Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) for dedicated facilities and the National Detention Standards for non-dedicated facilities. PBNDS has two versions: PBNDS 2008 and PBNDS 2011 with revisions in 2016. NDS also has two versions: NDS 2000 and NDS 2019. Between September 6, 2019 and May 27, 2021 198 facilities were inspected. Of these, 56.06% (n=111) were inspected under some version of PBNDS and 43.94% (n=87) were inspected under some version of NDS (Table 2.1). Among the 198 inspections reviewed, 94.95% (n=188) received a rating of either Meets Standards or Acceptable while 2.53% (n=5) were recommended Does Not Meet Standards or Deficient (Table 2.2).

Specifically, there are four categories of assaults listed: Detained Person on Staff with Serious Injury Detained Person on Staff without Serious Injury Detained Person on Detained Person with Serious Injury Detained Person on Detained Person without Serious Injury Conspicuously absent from this list of assault types are assaults on detained persons by staff. This is deeply concerning because already initial review of inspection forms and prior news stories indicates that staff assaults on detained persons do occur. For example, at the Bristol County County Jail and House of Corrections independent investigation by the Massachusetts Office of Attorney General (MAOG) found that facility staff found a planned and deliberate-use of force against the ICE detainees that was disproportionate to the security needs at that time and unnecessarily caused, or risked causing, harm to all involved (MA AOG 2020, ii). The MOAG found that facility staff used a flash bang grenade, pepper-ball launchers, pepper spray canisters, anti-riot shields, and caninesagainst detainees who had exhibited calm and nonviolent behavior for at least an hour before this operation (MA AOG 2020, ii). Investigations found that staff deployed these weapons both indiscriminately upon entry and also specifically against detainees who were not combative, assaultive, or otherwise actively resisting staff (MA AOG 2020, ii). While the aforementioned Bristol County Jail may be a particularly egregious instance of staff assaulting detained persons, it is not an isolated case. For example, video evidence from the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia NM shows CoreCivics private facility staff pepper spraying persons detained by ICE on hunger strike (Swetlitz 2020). Review of inspections has also revealed additional inappropriate use of force incidents. The omission of a field to record instances of staff assaulting detained persons occludes and obscures real instances of violence. As the inspections process is a detention reform designed to make a more humane system of civil incarceration, the omission of categories for logging staff physical mistreatment of detained persons raises serious questions about the inspections processes ability to record significant and documented civil and human rights violations. 3.1 Summary Tables Table 3.1: Total Assaults by Type Assault Type Total Assault Type detainee_physical_assault_on_staff_with_serious_injury 13 detainee_physical_assault_on_staff_with_no_serious_injury 333 detainee_on_detainee_physical_assault_fight_with_serious_injury 126 detainee_on_detainee_physical_assault_fight_with_no_serious_injury 2926 total_assaults 3398 Table 3.1: Total Assaults by Facility Facility Total Assaults by Facility Krome Service Processing Center 470 Adelanto ICE Processing Center - West 390 Prairieland Detention Center 330 South Texas ICE Processing Center 312 Adelanto ICE Processing Center - East 264 Otero County Processing Center 240 Aurora ICE Processing Center 222 Aurora ICE Processing Center II - Annex 222 Stewart Detention Center 218 Eloy Detention Center 216 Otay Mesa Detention Center 200 El Paso Service Processing Center 192 Winn Correctional Center 172 Essex County Correctional Facility 146 Imperial Regional Detention Facility 136 LaSalle ICE Processing Center 128 Hudson County Corrections and Rehabilitation Center 118 Immigration Centers of America - Farmville 108 River Correctional Center 106 Caroline Detention Facility 104 Jena LaSalle Detention Facility 98 Yuba County Jail 96 Adams County Correctional Center 94 La Palma Correctional Center 92 Bergen County Jail 86 Northwest ICE Processing Center 78 Catahoula Correctional Center 72 Mesa Verde ICE Processing Facility 72 Port Isabel Service Processing Center 70 Folkston ICE Processing Center 68 Bluebonnet Detention Center 64 Montgomery Processing Center 60 Pulaski County Detention Center 60 Sherburne County Jail 60 Houston Contract Detention Facility 58 Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center 58 Baker County Detention Center 54 Calhoun County Correctional Center 54 Limestone County Detention Center 50 Polk County Adult Detention Center 50 Irwin County Detention Center 48 McHenry County Adult Correctional Facility 48 Allen Parish Public Safety Complex 46 Strafford County Department of Corrections 46 Krome North Service Processing Center 40 Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility 34 Nye County Detention Center 34 Pike County Correctional Facility 32 Webb County Detention Center 32 CCA Florence Correctional Center 30 Joe Corley Processing Center 30 Wakulla County Detention Facility 30 David L.

Despite that fact, there is a tremendous amount of punitive disciplinary measures that take place in ICE detention. Some of this information on discipline in ICE detention is logged in facility inspections. As seen in the tables below, during the current sample period there were more than 42,000 disciplinary infractions. 4.1 Summary Tables Table 4.1: Total Disciplinary by Type Discipline Type Total Discipline Type disciplinary_infractions 25089 disciplinary_infractions_guilty 19610 disciplinary_appeals 1234 disciplinary_appeals_found_in_favor_of_detainee 295 sanctions_over_60_days 30 total_disciplinary 46258 Table 4.1: Total Discipline by Facility Facility Total Discipline by Facility Eloy Detention Center 7128 La Palma Correctional Center 6954 Krome Service Processing Center 4888 Sherburne County Jail 4070 Immigration Centers of America - Farmville 3808 Yuba County Jail 3712 Stewart Detention Center 3068 Aurora ICE Processing Center 2678 Aurora ICE Processing Center II - Annex 2678 Otay Mesa Detention Center 2504 Winn Correctional Center 2264 Calhoun County Correctional Center 2098 Montgomery Processing Center 2060 Caroline Detention Facility 1954 Bluebonnet Detention Center 1926 Otero County Processing Center 1924 South Texas ICE Processing Center 1912 Prairieland Detention Center 1596 Bergen County Jail 1432 Essex County Correctional Facility 1304 Adelanto ICE Processing Center - West 1284 El Paso Service Processing Center 1246 Imperial Regional Detention Facility 1240 Jena LaSalle Detention Facility 1234 Bristol County Jail and House of Correction 1186 LaSalle ICE Processing Center 1176 York County Prison 1172 Clinton County Correctional Facility 1166 Northwest ICE Processing Center 1070 Polk County Adult Detention Center 1010 River Correctional Center 924 Laredo Processing Center 888 Port Isabel Service Processing Center 848 Glades County Detention Center 822 Folkston ICE Processing Center 814 McHenry County Adult Correctional Facility 796 Adams County Correctional Center 756 Pulaski County Detention Center 746 Adelanto ICE Processing Center - East 742 Irwin County Detention Center 680 Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center 638 Hudson County Corrections and Rehabilitation Center 592 Butler County Jail 566 Pike County Correctional Facility 560 Folkston ICE Processing Center Annex 502 David L.

However, in at least some circumstances use of force incidents are inaccurately documented and under reported. For example, in some instances strip searches are tallied in total use of force summaries and in other cases they are not. The Bristol County Jail is one noteworthy instance where use of force incidents received independent evaluation. On May 2, 2020 Massachusetts news outlets reported on a major incident that occurred at the Bristol County House of Correction the previous day when detained persons expressed concern about the potential for COVID-19 infection from the facilitys medical wing (Dooling 2020). The Bristol County Sheriff claimed that people refused to go to the medical unit for testing, and those detained reported being attacked with pepper spray and dogs. Nakamoto Group Inspectors visited the facility between November 16-18, 2020 and reviewed it under PBNDS 2008 (ICE and The Nakamoto Group 2020). The inspectors received a G-324 SIS which reported use of force incidents (Figure 6.2). For May, the sheet lists 1 Immediate Use of Force Incident, 1 Use of Force with Chemical Agents, 1 Incident where Non-Lethal Weapons were Used, and 3 Strip Searches. The sheet lists no Use of Force with Serious Injury. Nakamoto Group inspectors found that the facility met all 39 standards and had only three deficient components: Key and Lock Control, Special Management Unit, and Suicide Prevention and Intervention. The Nakamoto inspection letter made no mention of use of force incidents. Figure 6.2: Cropped from Bristol County Jail SIS Form G-324 (ICE and The Nakamoto Group 2020, 4). The Massachusetts Attorney Generals Office (MA AG) independently investigated the major incident that occurred on May 1, 2020 (MA AG 2020). The MA AGs factual findings (MA AG 2020, 2441) identifies: 2 instances involving immediate use of force; 1 immediate use of force incident with a chemical agent; 1 calculated use of force incident that involved 16 officers armed with pepper spray, flash bang grenades, riot shields, shotguns with bean bag rounds, pepper ball launchers, battering rams, multiple K9 teams; and another 12 person restraint team. The Calculated Use of Force Incident unfolded over the course of more than an hour and involved the deployment of flash bang grenades; firing more than 30 rounds of pepper balls, several of which directly hit individuals; numerous instances involving K-9 use of force, and multiple hands on use of force instances. Additionally, the MA GA found multiple cases where individuals suffered serious injuries as the result of the use of force: 1 individual experienced cardiac arrest 1 individual with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suffered respiratory distress 1 individual experienced respiratory distress resulting in critically low oxygen levels The MA GA concluded that a series of institutional failures and poor decisions culminated in a planned and deliberateuse of force against the ICE B detainees that was disproportionate to the security needs at that time and unnecessarily caused, or risked causing, harm to all involved(MA AG 2020, ii). The MA GA found that facility staff used a flash bang grenade, pepper-ball launchers, pepper spray canisters, anti-riot shields, and caninesagainst detainees who had exhibited calm and nonviolent behavior for at least an hour before this operation(MA AG 2020, ii). The details of the May 1, 2020 Use of Force incident do not come to light in either SIS form or the Nakamoto Group inspection cover letter. The SIS form inaccurately characterizes the multiple Use of Force incidents entailed in the event, fails to report what is clearly a Calculated Use of Force, and does not report multiple Use of Force Incidents with Serious Injury that resulted from from the extensive use of pepper spray. The Nakamoto cover letter states that, the detainees felt safe in the facility and registered no substantive com-plaints about any aspect of their detention except for their exposure to the COVID-19 risk in the facility. Inspectors wrote that [t]here were no areas of concern or significant observations noted during the inspection but noted that the inspection was conducted remotely, and inspectors were unable to personally observe practices and procedures with-in the facility and that the inspection team relied upon photographs and/or videos to validate the observation of many standards. 6.3 Facet Plot of Use of Force by Facility References "],["sexual-abuse-and-assault-1.html", "Section 7 Sexual Abuse and Assault 7.1 Allegations 7.2 Substantiated Allegations", " Section 7 Sexual Abuse and Assault 7.1 Allegations 7.1.1 Summary Tables Table 7.1: Total Sexual Abuse and Assault Allegations by Type Allegation Type Total Allegation Type sexual_abuse_allegations_detainee_on_detainee 495 sexual_abuse_allegations_inmate_on_detainee 32 sexual_abuse_allegations_detainee_on_inmate 15 sexual_abuse_allegations_staff_contractor_volunteer_on_detainee 189 sexual_abuse_allegations_detainee_on_staff_contractor_volunteer 17 total_sexual_abuse_allegations 748 Table 7.1: Total Sexual Abuse and Assault Allegations by Facility Facility Total Allegations by Facility Otay Mesa Detention Center 160 Eloy Detention Center 122 Adelanto ICE Processing Center - West 102 Krome Service Processing Center 70 El Paso Service Processing Center 66 York County Prison 58 Montgomery Processing Center 44 South Texas ICE Processing Center 44 Northwest ICE Processing Center 36 Western Tennessee Detention Facility 36 Imperial Regional Detention Facility 32 Essex County Correctional Facility 24 Irwin County Detention Center 24 Adelanto ICE Processing Center - East 22 Bluebonnet Detention Center 22 Dodge County Detention Facility 22 Jackson Parish Correctional Center 22 LaSalle ICE Processing Center 22 Otero County Processing Center 22 Webb County Detention Center 22 Folkston ICE Processing Center 20 Caroline Detention Facility 18 Clinton County Correctional Facility 18 Yuba County Jail 18 Aurora ICE Processing Center 16 Aurora ICE Processing Center II - Annex 16 Calhoun County Correctional Center 16 CCA Florence Correctional Center 16 Hardin County Jail 16 Port Isabel Service Processing Center 16 Glades County Detention Center 14 Jena LaSalle Detention Facility 14 Okmulgee County Jail - Moore Detention Facility 14 Stewart Detention Center 14 Bergen County Jail 12 Eden Detention Center 12 Houston Contract Detention Facility 12 La Palma Correctional Center 12 Mesa Verde ICE Processing Facility 12 Prairieland Detention Center 12 Winn Correctional Center 12 Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center 10 Broward Transitional Center 8 Geauga County Jail 8 Joe Corley Processing Center 8 Limestone County Detention Center 8 Nye County Detention Center 8 Rio Grande Detention Center 8 River Correctional Center 8 Sherburne County Jail 8 Strafford County Department of Corrections 8 Baker County Detention Center 6 Florence Service Processing Center 6 Northern Oregon Correctional Facility 6 Torrance County Detention Facility 6 Adams County Correctional Center 4 Bristol County Jail and House of Correction 4 David L.

"],["references.html", "References", " References "],["appendix-a-reading-in-sis-forms.html", "Appendix A: Reading in SIS Forms 2 Summary Tables 3 Facet Plots", " Appendix A: Reading in SIS Forms The code for this report is specific to data logged in the G-324A-19 form and the incident summaries portion of that form. The incident summary portion of this form is probably the most complex data structure in the project and also contains the largest volume of quantitative information. Therefore, it seemed like a good place to start with an initial proof of concept. At the outset, there were issues reading in the Google Sheet. Several of the numeric columns read into R as lists which was undesirable. In the Google Sheet, Craig set the columns to plain text rather than auto and the data are read into R as character columns. This seemed to resolve the issue for a time, and it was possible to use the type_convert() function from the readr library (Wickham and Hester 2020) to convert these columns to numbers. The col_types argument of the read_sheet function of the googlesheets4 library (Bryan 2021) was used to explicitly set the column types to character. After applying the clean_facility_names custom function, additional transformations like converting facility to a factor are applied. There were some issues using lubridate (Spinu, Grolemund, and Wickham 2021) to wrangle the month and year fields to a proper date. Craig was not able to discern the cause of the issue. However, changing the month format on the incident sheet from abbreviated to fully written out months solved the issue. Those changes were made in the master Google Sheet and the data were called using the googlesheets4 library. At present 374 SIS and inspection cover letter combinations out of approximately 300 inspections are complete. The completed inspections range in time from 2019-09-06 to 2021-05-27. Students are now working on older SIS forms which are structured differently. The preliminary EDA in this document is restricted to the more current SIS forms which were first used in May 2019. 2 Summary Tables Summary tables help to provide an overview of how many instances occur within particular category of data or how frequent a particular issue is recorded at a given facility. Summary tables are generated using a combination of group_by with summarize with the results piped to kable and kableExtra. This produces results similar to a pivot table from Excel. 3 Facet Plots Facet plots partition each portion of a plot into a matrix of panels. These plots are produced for several categories of data where each panel represents a facility for a given variable reported in the SIS form. Within each category, columns are pivoted longer and plotted by date. Graphing is done using the ggplot2 library (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2021) with the facet_wrap function to provide a means to compare multiple facilities simultaneously. Such a plot can help identify trends and guide more specific questions. References "],["appendix-b-data-cleaning.html", "Appendix B: Data Cleaning 4 Cleaning Script", " Appendix B: Data Cleaning Anyone familiar working with ICE data knows that the agency is notorious for releasing dirty data filled with pesky errors. For example, consider the Krome Service Processing Center, the very first immigration processing center established in the 1980s after the closure of Ellis Island in 1954. Of all the facilities the agency should name consistently, Krome the very first detention center of the contemporary system, one would expect ICE to get right. However, the facility inspections page lists the following names for the Krome Service Processing Center: Krome Special Processing Center (SPC) (FL) - Feb. 10, 2021 Krome Service Procesing Center (FL) - Feb. 13, 2020 Krome SPC (FL) - Feb. 14, 2019 Every instance is different. In one case Special is replaced for Service. In another case the word processing is misspelled Procesing, while in a third, the title is abbreviated. This is one example of many. In other cases facilities are sometimes named Detention Center rather than Detention Facility, etc. Assembling the data into a useful table that can be sorted, filtered, and summarized requires standardizing the names. From early on, Craig decided to assemble the data as reported, errors and all, and perform standardization programmatically. Doing this facilitates reproducibility. The projects primary cleaning functions are incorporated into a custom function clean_facility_names() and moved to a separate R file. This allows more than 100 lines of code to be collapsed into a single function call. However, for display purposes, the lines of code that make up the transformations are detailed on this page. 4 Cleaning Script During the time that the students were assembling data, we worked out of a Google Sheet as this permitted each of us to have simultaneous access to the data. For preliminary analysis, a data frame is constructed by reading from the sheet. # Read in the sheet df_inspect &lt;- read_sheet(&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1im5VSi3bIEi13O8WQ56wEIXSyNEstbGMylXXgD9bAG0/edit#gid=1858227071&quot;, sheet=&quot;Inspections&quot;, col_names = TRUE, col_types = &quot;c&quot;) %&gt;% clean_names() Sometimes facility names are repeated. Use of the dplyr function distinct is useful for isolating issues with field names (Wickham, François, et al. 2021).
