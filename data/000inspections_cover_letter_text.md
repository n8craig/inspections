# ID 25: Adams County Correctional Center (MS) - Dec. 3, 2020

## Interviews

*The inspection team interviewed via telephone a total of 21 detainees including ten LEP detainees (by bilingual inspectors or with translator services), females, males, and detainees in administrative and disciplinary segregation. All 21 of the interviews were conducted in a confidential setting including all LEP detainee interviews. Detainee interviews revealed an overall favorable opinion of medical care, access to legal materials, detainee mail system, access to telephones, and the opportunity to speak to facility supervisors and officers. There was one detainee interviewed that was too emotional to complete the interview. The detainee was referred to the medical department. A mental health professional met with the detainee within hours. Detainees interviewed were asked if they had filed a grievance and/or had called the OIG hotline. When they responded in the negative, detainees were informed of the grievance process and the availability of the OIG hotline. All staff interviewed via telephone*

*exhibited a positive professional demeanor and attitude.*

## Areas of Concern

*There were no areas of concern or significant observation noted during the inspection. The inspection was conducted remotely and inspectors were unable to personally observe practices and procedures within the facility. The inspection team relied upon photographs and/or videos to validate the observation of many standards. Additionally, interviews via telephone were conducted with multiple key staff members.*

## Notes

Three standards were found Not Applicable, but nothing in either the SIS or the CL provides any basis for determining which standards these were.

## Interviews

*The inspection team found the environment to be calm. The inspection team interviewed no less than 85 detainees including twenty LEP detainees (by bilingual inspectors), females, males, and detainees in administrative segregation. No less than 35 of the interviews were conducted in a confidential setting including all LEP detainee interviews. Detainee interviews revealed an overall favorable opinion of medical care, access to legal materials, detainee mail system, access to telephones, and the opportunity to speak to facility supervisors and ICE officers. Many of the detainees interviewed stated that they did not like the food and that the menu had changed since the Bureau of Prisons inmates left the facility. The Safety SME reviewed the current menus, ensured that they were prepared using recipes, observed the portions and found that the food met the dietary requirements established by the dietitian. Several detainees shared that medical had not been responsive to their requests. A medical SME reviewed the medical charts of those detainees and found that they all were actively being seen on a regular basis by medical.* (page 2)

## Areas of Concern/Significant Observations

*There were no areas of concern or significant observations noted during the inspection.* (page 3)

## Notes

ACCC was built by CoreCivic in 2007 and housed BOP inmates until August 16, 2019 when BOP inmates were moved out. ICE began incarcerating people at the facility in June 29, 2019. The facility is operated by CoreCivic via an IGSA with Adams County.

Note that BOP inmates "were moved out" but that Nakamoto interviewers found that "[M]any of the detainees interviewed stated that they did not like the food and that the menu had changed since the Bureau of Prisons inmates left the facility" (page 2).

## Interviews

*The facility consists of direct supervision dormitory-style housing with an officer stationed inside each dormitory at all times and camera and direct surveillance from the control centers. Dayroom areas provide adequate open space and sedentary activities such as television viewing and board games. Telephones are provided in the housing units and are available to detainees 24 hours a day. There are also two computer kiosks providing access to LexisNexis in each housing unit. Outdoor recreation is available seven days a week. Sanitation was observed to be average with some clutter noted in the sleeping areas. Detainees interviewed during the inspection voiced few complaints regarding sanitation. Two female detainees complained of mold in housing unit D-1. One of the detainees pointed out an area on a back wall underneath a bunk that had a black discoloration on the wall and baseboard that may be mold. The other detainee stated that there was mold underneath the bench in one of the showers. Some soap scum was noted; however, there did not appear to be any mold. These areas were pointed out to facility staff. It was also noted that the heating vents and ceiling in the upper level sleeping area was in need of cleaning.*

*A male detainee approached an inspector with a litany of complaints about his treatment by officers and the lack of medical care for his high blood pressure. Investigation of his complaints found that he had been moved from the West facility because he was continually late when detainees from his housing unit were taken to the dining room for meals resulting in him missing meals from time to time. He was moved to the East facility where the meals are served in the housing units and he won’t miss any meals. The Medical SME reviewed his medical chart and found that he has been seen by medical staff regularly and his blood pressure is being monitored. The detainee also stated that he had been on a hunger strike but when questioned further he admitted that he had only refused a couple of meals and never declared a hunger strike.*

*A female detainee stated that she has sent numerous requests to her ICE officer and has not received a response to these requests. A review of the request log and copies of the requests from the detainee indicated that her requests have all been responded to in a timely manner by the officer. The detainee also stated that she had suffered a concussion and had received no follow-up treatment. A review of her medical records indicated that she had been injured when another detainee fell on her while climbing up to the bunk above her. She was treated at the time of the accident and has been seen several times for ongoing complaints. She has been seen by a neurologist. Another female detainee complained about the lack of medical care. A review of her medical record indicated that she has been seen numerous times by medical staff and all of her complaints have been addressed.*

*The telephonic translation line was used to conduct interviews of LEP detainees from Mexico and China. All of the detainees stated they felt safe at the facility. None of the detainees expressed any concerns about the facility. Several detainees from China informed inspectors that they had been unable to call their families. It was determined that the telephone provider (TALTON) is in negotiations with China to permit detainee calls. Facility staff stated that the detainees would be permitted to attempt to contact their families using a facility telephone. The inspection team visited the housing units several times during the inspection to conduct group and confidential interviews. The atmosphere was relaxed and detainees were observed interacting with facility staff and other detainees. They approached the inspection team without hesitation. No detainees expressed any concerns about their safety. There were no concerns regarding the law library or recreation. Detainees were aware of the procedures to request health care.* (page 2-3)

## Areas of Concern/Significant Observations

*The facility achieves optimal compliance with a number of standard requirements such as telephone ratios, law library access, and outdoor recreation.* (page 3)

## Notes

Though inspectors reported that there were "two computer kiosks providing access to LexisNexis in each housing unit" inspectors determined that law library access "achieves optimal compliance" (pages 2-3).

# 290 Adelanto ICE Processing Center-East (CA) - Oct. 11, 2018

## Interviews

*Without exception, detainees stated that they feel safe at the facility. Detainees freely approached the inspectors to converse and no less than 71 detainees were interviewed during the inspection, 26 of which were formal confidential interviews. The language line was used as necessary. LEP detainees stated that they had no issues obtaining services. Confidential interviews revealed no concerns. Two detainees complained that one officer did not treat them with respect, but they had not filed any complaints or grievances about the officer. The detainees were advised of the processes for filing grievances to ICE and contacting the OIG. One detainee complained that they had not seen their ICE officer. Logs and visiting liaison checklists combined to indicate that ICE officers had been in the housing unit to interview detainees at least weekly during the inspection period. The detainee was advised to send a request form to ICE to guarantee an interview. One detainee asked about the permissibility of crafts for recreation in the housing units, and she was referred to facility staff. There were seven complaints regarding medical services. One was about the lack of an eye exam, for which the detainee was already scheduled. Three were regarding the lack of follow-up appointments, and the Medical SME determined that all three were scheduled for follow-up appointments the next day. One complained that her medication had been taken by staff, and the Medical Inspector learned that the medication was expired and had to be re-issued. One detainee stated that she had a rash, and it was discovered that she is currently receiving medical care for the rash. The last complaint was about a follow-up appointment for a toothache. The Medical Inspector found that the detainee is scheduled for an appointment with an oral surgeon.* (page 2)

## Areas of Concern/Significant Observations

*ICE and facility staff expressed concerns over the recent OIG report in terms of the characterizations of certain information and erroneous reporting. Of note were the OIG’s reference to “nooses” in the living areas. Examination of the pictures presented as evidence in the report indicated that the sheets were being used as privacy curtains or clotheslines, and were tied up loosely so that they could be easily pulled down for use by the detainees. The local staff indicated that they explained this to the OIG inspectors, but nonetheless they chose to use the inflammatory term of “nooses”, even though there was no question about the purpose of the sheets. The OIG report also tied the privacy curtains and clotheslines to suicide prevention, when in fact there was no evidence to suggest that any privacy curtain or clothesline was used for such purposes. In the expert judgement of the inspection team, this mischaracterization in the OIG report only serves to exaggerate a housekeeping infraction. There were no makeshift clotheslines or privacy curtains observed during this inspection.*

*The OIG report also stated there had been no dental fillings or cleanings performed by the dental staff for the past four years; and that a dentist indicated that detainees could use strings from their socks as dental floss. Records revealed that a number of cleanings and fillings had been completed during the months prior to the OIG inspection, and have continued throughout the inspection period. Further, the witnessing staff indicated that the dentist was relaying a story from his past employment at a state correctional facility when he talked about threads being used as dental floss. He never suggested that detainees should do so.*

*The G-324 records more examples of inaccurately reported findings in the recent OIG report, to include those regarding the presence of segregation orders and medical rounds in segregation. It would be advantageous for OIG to use inspectors with detention and corrections backgrounds for future inspections to avoid this type of embarrassment to their office and ICE, especially since the inaccuracies have now been reported by the news media as fact.* (page 3)

## Notes

Nakamoto went to considerable length to address and negate concerns expressed in a DHS OIG [-@dhsoig2018a] report that came out prior prior to the inspection. Nakamoto asserts that the findings of the OIG report are baseless and the "report only serves to exaggerate a housekeeping infraction." Nakamoto suggests that OIG "use inspectors with detention and corrections backgrounds for future inspections" to avoid "embarrassment to their office and ICE." It bears noting that DHS OIG previously found Nakamoto inspectors lacking in rigor [@dhsoig2018b] and have since concluded that DHS OIG's unannounced inspections successfully identified noncompliance issues that "inhibit the facilities' ability to establish environments that protect the rights, health and safety of detainees" [@dhsoig2020a].
